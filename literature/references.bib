Secondly, for the quantum spin--boson model we prove, by carefully taking a large spin limit, that Bohr's quantum--classical correspondence persists at all coupling strengths. This shows, for the first time, the validity of the quantum--classical correspondence for an open system and gives insight into the regimes where the quantum system is well-approximated by a classical one. Finally, we provide the first classification of the coupling parameter regimes for the spin--boson model, from weak to ultrastrong, both for the quantum case and the classical setting. Our results shed light on the interplay of quantum and mean force corrections in equilibrium states of the spin--boson model, and will help draw the quantum to classical boundary in a range of fields, such as magnetism and exciton dynamics.},

I want to establish a rigorous and general framework for functional quantum noises from the constructive and computational perspectives, i.e., how to generate the random trajectories to reproduce the kernel and path ordering of the influence functional with effective Monte Carlo methods for arbitrary spectral densities. This construction approach aims to unify the existing stochastic models to rigorously describe the temporary and spatial structure of Gaussian quantum noises. In this paper, I review the Euclidean imaginary time influence functional and propose the stochastic matrix multiplication scheme to calculate reduced equilibrium density matrices (REDM). In addition, I review and discuss the Feynman-Vernon influence functional according to the Gaussian quadratic integral, particularly its imaginary part which is critical to the rigorous description of the quantum detailed balance. As a result, I establish the conditions under which the influence functional can be interpreted as the average of exponential functional operator over real-valued Gaussian processes for open multilevel quantum systems. I also show the difference between the local and nonlocal phonons within this framework. With the stochastic matrix multiplication scheme, I compare the normalized REDM with the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution for open multilevel quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield                                b                 e                 t                 t                 e                 r                              results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system                                f                 o                 l                 k                 l                 o                 r                 e                              regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.},

  abstract  = {Quantum error mitigation (EM) is a collection of strategies to reduce errors on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices on which proper quantum error correction is not feasible. One of such strategies entails implementing the inverse of a known noise map of an environment by using a set of completely positive maps weighted by a quasiprobability distribution, i.e., a probability distribution with positive and negative values. This distribution is realized using classical postprocessing after final measurements of desired observables have been made. Here we make a connection with quasiprobability EM and recent results from quantum trajectory theory for open quantum systems. We show that the inverse of noise maps can be realized by performing classical postprocessing with a quasiprobability measure called the influence martingale on the quantum trajectories generated by an additional engineered reservoir coupled to the system. We demonstrate our result on a model relevant for current NISQ devices. Finally, we show the required quantum trajectories themselves can be simulated by coupling an ancillary qubit to the system. In this way, we can avoid the introduction of the engineered reservoir.},

  abstract = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.},

  abstract  = {It is generally observed that if a dynamical system is sufficiently complex, then as time progresses it will share out energy and other properties amongst its component parts to eliminate any initial imbalances, retaining only fluctuations. This is known as energy dissipation and it is closely associated with the concept of thermodynamic irreversibility, measured by the increase in entropy according to the second law. It is of interest to quantify such behaviour from a dynamical rather than a thermodynamic perspective and to this end stochastic entropy production and the time-integrated dissipation function have been introduced as analogous measures of irreversibility, principally for stochastic and deterministic dynamics, respectively. We seek to compare these measures. First we modify the dissipation function to allow it to measure irreversibility in situations where the initial probability density function (pdf) of the system is asymmetric as well as symmetric in velocity. We propose that it tests for failure of what we call the obversibility of the system, to be contrasted with reversibility, the failure of which is assessed by stochastic entropy production. We note that the essential difference between stochastic entropy production and the time-integrated modified dissipation function lies in the sequence of procedures undertaken in the associated tests of irreversibility. We argue that an assumed symmetry of the initial pdf with respect to velocity inversion (within a framework of deterministic dynamics) can be incompatible with the Past Hypothesis, according to which there should be a statistical distinction between the behaviour of certain properties of an isolated system as it evolves into the far future and the remote past. Imposing symmetry on a velocity distribution is acceptable for many applications of statistical physics, but can introduce difficulties when discussing irreversible behaviour.},

  abstract      = {The spin-boson model usually considers a spin coupled to a single bosonic bath. However, some physical situations require coupling of the spin to multiple environments. For example, spins interacting with phonons in three-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we consider a spin coupled isotropically to three independent baths. We show that coupling to multiple baths can significantly increase entanglement between the spin and its environment at zero temperature. The effect of this is to reduce the spin's expectation values in the mean force equilibrium state. In contrast, the classical three-bath spin equilibrium state turns out to be entirely independent of the environmental coupling. These results reveal purely quantum effects that can arise from multi-bath couplings, with potential applications in a wide range of settings, such as magnetic materials.},

The first is based on the decay of memory effects with time separation and leads to well-known iterative quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (i-QuAPI) schemes. The other two mechanisms exploit the prominent role of classical decoherence. Removal of classical memory is possible through the introduction of auxiliary variables, leading to efficient and accurate quantum--classical path integral (QCPI) methods. A third way is proposed, which involves systematic corrections to the fully incoherent limit. An efficient procedure for summing all paths associated with `blips' (short off-diagonal path pair segments) is described. The ideas are illustrated with numerical calculations of tunneling dynamics.},

  abstract   = {The longstanding question of how stochastic behaviour arises from deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics is of great importance, and any truly holistic theory must be capable of describing this transition. In this review, we introduce the influence functional formalism in both the quantum and classical regimes. Using this technique, we demonstrate how irreversible behaviour arises generically from the reduced microscopic dynamics of a system-environment amalgam. The influence functional is then used to rigorously derive stochastic equations of motion from a microscopic Hamiltonian. In this method stochastic terms are not identified heuristically, but instead arise from an exact mapping only available in the path-integral formalism. The interpretability of the individual stochastic trajectories arising from the mapping is also discussed. As a consequence of these results, we are also able to show that the proper classical limit of stochastic quantum dynamics corresponds non-trivially to a generalised Langevin equation derived with the classical influence functional. This provides a further unifying link between open quantum systems and their classical equivalent, highlighting the utility of influence functionals and their potential as a tool in both fundamental and applied research.},

Whereas cooling can be achieved in the weak-drive regime, high-amplitude pulses can generate Boltzmann-distributed populations from a temperature of 110 mK up to 500 mK within 100 ns. As we propose in our work, this fast and efficient temperature control provides an appealing opportunity to demonstrate a quantum heat engine.

With it we confirm that the DOS of the well-known Debye model for three-dimensional solids is physically equivalent to choosing an Ohmic bath. We further match a real phonon DOS to a series of Lorentzian coupling functions, allowing us to determine coupling parameters for gold, yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and iron as examples. The results illustrate how to obtain material-specific dynamical properties, such as memory kernels. The proposed method opens the door to more accurate modelling of relaxation dynamics, for example for phonon-dominated spin damping in magnetic materials.},

  abstract   = {Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.},

Despite many successful applications, the method has never been obtained from first principles, relying instead on the ``Im\,F'' premise. In this paper, the same expression for the rate of barrier penetration at finite temperature is rederived from quantum scattering theory [W. H. Miller, S. D. Schwartz, and J. W. Tromp, J. Chem. Phys. 79, 4889 (1983)] using a semiclassical Green's function formalism. This justifies the instanton approach and provides a route to deriving the rate of other processes.},

This gives equations which can be used to compute the rates of electron-transfer reactions in the nonadiabatic (golden-rule) limit numerically within a semiclassical approximation. The multidimensional ring-polymer instanton trajectories are obtained efficiently by minimization of the action. In this form, comparison with Wolynes' quantum instanton method [P. G. Wolynes, J.

  abstract   = {For a system strongly coupled to a heat bath, the quantum coherence of the system and the heat bath plays an important role in the system dynamics. This is particularly true in the case of non-Markovian noise. We rigorously investigate the influence of system-bath coherence by deriving the reduced hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM), not only in real time, but also in imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature. It is shown that the HEOM in real time obtained when we include the system-bath coherence of the initial thermal equilibrium state possess the same form as those obtained from a factorized initial state. We find that the difference in behavior of systems treated in these two manners results from the difference in initial conditions of the HEOM elements, which are defined in path integral form. We also derive HEOM along the imaginary time path to obtain the thermal equilibrium state of a system strongly coupled to a non-Markovian bath. Then, we show that the steady state hierarchy elements calculated from the real-time HEOM can be expressed in terms of the hierarchy elements calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM. Moreover, we find that the imaginary-time HEOM allow us to evaluate a number of thermodynamic variables, including the free energy, entropy, internal energy, heat capacity, and susceptibility. The expectation values of the system energy and system-bath interaction energy in the thermal equilibrium state are also evaluated.},

The equation is true only to the lowest order in the interaction between system and bath.

  abstract = {Elementary parameter-differentiation techniques are developed to systematically derive a wide variety of operator identities, expansions, and solutions to differential equations of interest to quantum physics. The treatment is largely centered around a general closed formula for the derivative of an exponential operator with respect to a parameter. Derivations are given of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and its dual, the Zassenhaus formula. The continuous analogs of these formulas which solve the differential equation dY(t)/dt = A(t) Y(t), the solutions of Magnus and Fer, respectively, are similarly derived in a recursive manner which manifestly displays the general repeated-commutator nature of these expansions and which is quite suitable for computer programming. An expansion recently obtained by Kumar and another new expansion are shown to be derivable from the Fer and Magnus solutions, respectively, in the same way. Useful similarity transformations involving linear combinations of elements of a Lie algebra are obtained. Some cases where the product eAeB can be written as a closed-form single exponential are considered which generalize results of Sack and of Weiss and Maradudin. Closed-form single-exponential solutions to the differential equation dY(t)/dt = A(t) Y(t) are obtained for two cases and compared with the corresponding multiple-exponential solutions of Wei and Norman. Normal ordering of operators is also treated and derivations, corollaries, or generalization of a number of known results are efficiently obtained. Higher derivatives of exponential and general operators are discussed by means of a formula due to Poincar\'e which is the operator analog of the Cauchy integral formula of complex variable theory. It is shown how results obtained by Aizu for matrix elements and traces of derivatives may be readily derived from the Poincar\'e formula. Some applications of the results of this paper to quantum statistics and to the Weyl prescription for converting a classical function to a quantum operator are given. A corollary to a theorem of Bloch is obtained which permits one to obtain harmonic-oscillator canonical-ensemble averages of general operators defined by the Weyl prescription. Solutions of the density-matrix equation are also discussed. It is shown that an initially canonical ensemble behaves as though its temperature remains constant with a ``canonical distribution'' determined by a certain fictitious Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Quantum states in complex aggregates are unavoidably affected by environmental effects, which typically cannot be accurately modeled by simple Markovian processes. As system sizes scale up, nonperturbative simulation becomes thus unavoidable, but they are extremely challenging due to the intimate interplay of intrinsic many-body interaction and time-retarded feedback from environmental degrees of freedom. In this work, we utilize the recently developed quantum dissipation with minimally extended state space approach to address reservoir induced long-ranged temporal correlations in finite size Ising-type spin chains. For thermal reservoirs with ohmic and subohmic spectral density, we simulate the quantum time evolution from finite to zero temperature. The competition between thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations, and anti-/ferromagnetic interactions reveals a rich pattern of dynamical phases, including dissipative induced phase transitions and spatiotemporal correlations.},

  abstract      = {Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.},
