# WRE-NCNG-1

## Model
- Same non-commuting non-Gaussian qutrit reference as WRE-NU-1.

## Procedure
- Generate candidate master-basis operators from adjoint-chain products.
- Fit `H_MF = -(1/beta) log rho_S^ED` in increasing basis size.

## What is plotted
- Residual versus basis size at representative `(beta,coupling)` points.
- Log-scale saturation trend quantifies closure quality.
