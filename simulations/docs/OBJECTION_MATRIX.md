# Objection Matrix (what_rules_equilibrium)

| Objection | Test | Quantitative criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Master-algebra closure is only formal | WRE-MA-1 | computed `dim(A)` respects `d^2` bound and finite closure order |
| Truncation inequivalence is anecdotal | WRE-NU-1 | both poly and comm truncations dominate in nontrivial parameter fractions |
| Quantum-classical equivalence is not constructive | WRE-QC-1 | low trace mismatch with explicit classical parameter cost |
| Full-case basis claim is untested | WRE-NCNG-1 | residual decreases as candidate basis size increases |
