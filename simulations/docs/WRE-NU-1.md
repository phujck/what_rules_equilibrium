# WRE-NU-1

## Model
- Non-commuting qutrit from static spin-field trace-out:
  `rho_S^ED = sum_B p(B) e^{-beta(H_S+Bf)}/Tr[...]`.

## Truncations compared
- Polynomial basis: `{I, f^2, f^4}`.
- Commutator basis: `{I, f, i[H_S,f]}`.

## What is plotted
- Residual surfaces for both truncations and residual gap map.
- The sign of residual gap identifies which truncation is better at each point.
