\title{What Rules Equilibrium?\\Non-Uniqueness, Algebraic Closure, and Quantum--Classical Equivalence\\in the Hamiltonian of Mean Force}

\begin{abstract}
The equilibrium state of an open quantum system is determined by the Hamiltonian of mean force --- an operator encoding all environmental influence at finite coupling strength. Two distinct sources of operator complexity control its structure: non-Gaussianity of the bath statistics, which generates a polynomial hierarchy $\{f^{2n}\}$ in the coupling operator, and non-commutativity $[H_S,f]\neq 0$, which generates a commutator hierarchy $\{\ad_{H_S}^r(f)\}$. We show that the complete operator content of $\HMF$ is governed by a single \emph{master algebra}: the associative algebra generated by products of adjoint-chain elements across all cumulant orders. For finite-dimensional systems, this algebra always closes, yielding an exact, finite-parameter representation of $\HMF$. We prove three results. First, the master-algebra closure determines when a finite-form $\HMF$ exists and dictates its maximal operator content. Second, the same equilibrium state admits multiple exact series representations in different operator bases; truncation of any one series produces an approximation that is structurally inequivalent to truncations of other series, explaining the well-known disagreements between strong-coupling methods. Third, for any finite-dimensional system coupled to a quantum Gaussian bath, there exists a classical non-Gaussian bath that produces the identical equilibrium reduced state, and conversely --- establishing a formal duality between quantumness and non-Gaussianity at equilibrium. We classify closure regimes for qubits, qutrits, harmonic oscillators, and many-body spin chains, and provide explicit constructions in each case.
